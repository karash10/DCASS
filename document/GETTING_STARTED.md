## 4. Quick Start (No Docker)

This runs the pipeline **locally** without building containers. Useful for development.

### Step 1: Build the FAISS indices

Download the Flickr8k dataset and build the image index:

```bash
python scripts/download_flickr8k.py
python scripts/build_indices.py --modality image
```

> Building indices takes ~5–15 minutes depending on hardware.

### Step 2: Test the encoder

```bash
python -m src.cli.main encode "Meet me at the park at noon"
```

Expected output: a sequence of media IDs (image/text/audio) representing the message.

### Step 3: Test the full encode → distribute pipeline

```bash
python -m src.cli.main distribute "Meet me at the park at noon" casual
```

This encodes the message and dispatches media IDs through the local folder channel (outputs to `phase3_out/`).

### Step 4: Test the stealth scheduler (no checkpoints needed)

The scheduler automatically falls back to static mode when no trained model exists:

```bash
python scripts/run_sender.py \
  --mode auto \
  --shared-dir ./shared_channel \
  --dry-run
```

You should see:
```
Auto mode: attempting RL scheduling …
[StealthScheduler] RL checkpoint not found — falling back to static
Auto mode: RL unavailable, attempting GAN scheduling …
[StealthScheduler] GAN checkpoint not found — falling back to static
Auto mode: no trained checkpoints found — falling back to STATIC
```

---

## 5. Quick Start (Docker)

### Step 1: Build the Docker images

```bash
docker compose build
# or
make docker-build
```

This builds a Python 3.10 image with PyTorch (CPU), FAISS, Gymnasium, and all DCASS dependencies.

### Step 2: Run Alice (Sender) + Bob (Receiver)

```bash
docker compose up
# or
make docker-send
```

**What happens**:
1. Bob (Receiver) starts, watches `/app/shared_channel`
2. Alice (Sender) starts once Bob is healthy
3. Alice builds a 20-item media sequence
4. Alice uses `StealthScheduler(mode=auto)` → tries RL → tries GAN → falls back to static (since no checkpoints exist yet)
5. Alice writes packet JSON files to the shared volume
6. Bob picks them up, reassembles the sequence after a silence threshold

### Step 3: Watch the logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f dcass-alice    # Sender logs
docker compose logs -f dcass-bob      # Receiver logs
```

### Step 4: Inspect the packets

```bash
ls -la shared_channel/
cat shared_channel/_manifest.json
```

### Step 5: Stop everything

```bash
docker compose down
# or
make docker-clean
```

---

## 6. What Happens Under the Hood

### Dynamic → Static Fallback (The Key Feature)

When the sender runs in `auto` mode, it tries scheduling modes in this order:

```
auto mode
  ├── 1. Try RL  (looks for models/rl/ppo_agent_final.pt)
  │      ↓ not found → logs warning → try next
  ├── 2. Try GAN (looks for models/gan/final.pt)
  │      ↓ not found → logs warning → try next
  └── 3. Static  (NoiseController — always works, no model needed)
```

The `StealthScheduler` (`src/stealth/stealth_scheduler.py`) handles this cascade. Once you train models later (see [SCRIPTS.md](./SCRIPTS.md)), the sender will automatically pick them up.

### Packet Metadata Format

Each transmitted item is written as a JSON file to `shared_channel/`:

```json
{
  "media_id": "media_003",
  "channel_id": 1,
  "sequence_number": 3,
  "delay_seconds": 4.7,
  "timestamp": 1712345678.123,
  "mode_used": "static"
}
```

The `mode_used` field tells you whether static, GAN, or RL scheduling was used.

## 7. Configuration

All system parameters live in `config/default.yaml`. Key sections:

```yaml
# Stealth AI — enable when models are trained
stealth:
  gan:
    enabled: false      # Set true after training
  rl:
    enabled: false      # Set true after training

# Distribution timing
distribution:
  base_delay: 3         # Seconds between transmissions
  default_policy: round_robin

# Noise profiles
# Edit src/distribution/profiles.py for custom profiles
```

---

## 8. Environment Variables

Set in `docker-compose.yml` or `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DCASS_MODE` | `auto` | Sender mode: `auto` / `rl` / `gan` / `static` |
| `DCASS_PROFILE` | `casual` | Noise profile: `casual` / `stealth` / `bursty` |
| `DCASS_SEQ_LENGTH` | `20` | Number of items in the test sequence |
| `DCASS_BASE_DELAY` | `3.0` | Base inter-item delay (seconds) |
| `DCASS_SHARED_DIR` | `/app/shared_channel` | Packet drop directory |
| `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | `""` | Leave empty for CPU mode |
| `GAN_EPOCHS` | `50` | Epochs for GAN training service |
| `RL_EPISODES` | `1000` | Episodes for RL training service |

Override from the command line:

```bash
DCASS_MODE=static DCASS_SEQ_LENGTH=50 docker compose up
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: faiss`

FAISS is only installed inside Docker. For local development:
```bash
pip install faiss-cpu
```

### Receiver never reassembles

The receiver waits for a **silence threshold** (10s by default) after the last packet. If you use `--dry-run` on the sender, packets arrive instantly but the receiver still waits. Either wait 10 seconds or reduce `--timeout`:

```bash
python scripts/run_receiver.py --watch ./shared_channel --timeout 3
```

### Docker: `shared_channel` volume conflict

```bash
docker compose down --volumes
docker compose up
```

### Slow Docker build

The first build downloads PyTorch (CPU, ~500 MB). Subsequent builds use the cache and are fast.

### GAN / RL checkpoint not found (expected)

If you see this in logs, it's **correct behavior** — the system is falling back to static:
```
[StealthScheduler] RL checkpoint not found — falling back to static
```
Training scripts are in `scripts/train_gan.py` and `scripts/train_rl.py`. See [SCRIPTS.md](./SCRIPTS.md) for when to run them.
